Welcome CarlG96,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!

# Space Traveller

## Purpose of Space Traveller
Space Traveller is a text-based adventure game in a science fiction setting. The game receives input from the user and through this the user navigates through a number of scenarios, either passing them and moving on to the next one or failing. There are five scenarios the player must navigate through by inputting commands and completing all five of them will result in the user completing the game. The user will choose the name of their captain, their spaceship and will decide upon 3 of 5 'cargo' to hold on their ship to potentially use throughout the game.
